Note: The partition size needed to capture a week of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. Typically, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records should be sufficient. If the partition used is not exclusively for audit logs, then determine the amount of additional space needed to support the partition reserving enough space for audit logs."
