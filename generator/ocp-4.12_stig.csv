Once an attacker establishes access to an application, the attacker often attempts to remove authorized accounts to disrupt services or prevent the implementation of countermeasures. Auditing account removal actions provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.

To address access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise-level authentication/access/audit mechanisms meeting or exceeding access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to off-load those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality.","","Verify the audit rules capture the execution of setuid and setgid binaries by executing the following:
 
for node in $(oc get node -oname); do oc debug $node -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'echo -n ""$HOSTNAME ""; grep -e key=privileged /etc/audit/audit.rules || echo ""not found""' 2>/dev/null; done

OpenShift provides a robust RBAC policy system that allows for authorization policies to be as detailed as needed. Additionally, there are two layers of RBAC policies. The first is Cluster RBAC policies which administrators can control who has what access to cluster level services. The other is Local RBAC policies, which allow project developers/administrators to control what level of access users have to a given project or namespace.

OpenShift provides a set of default roles out of the box, and additional roles may be added as needed. Each role has a set of rules controlling what access that role may have, and users and/or groups may be bound to one or more roles. The cluster-admin cluster level RBAC role has complete super admin privileges and it is a required role for select cluster administrators to have.

The OpenShift Container Platform includes a built-in image registry. The primary purpose is to allow users to create, import, and generally manage images running in the cluster. This registry is integrated with the authentication and authorization (RBAC) services on the cluster.

Restricting access permissions and providing access only to the necessary components and resources within the OpenShift environment reduces the potential impact of security breaches and unauthorized activities.

Review the RBAC configuration.

As the cluster-admin, view the cluster roles and their associated rule sets by executing the following:

oc describe clusterrole.rbac

Now, view the current set of cluster role bindings, which shows the users and groups that are bound to various roles by executing the following:

oc describe clusterrolebinding.rbac

Local roles and bindings can be determined by executing the following:

oc describe rolebinding.rbac

If these results show users with privileged access that do not require that access, this is a finding.","If users or groups exist that are bound to roles they must not have, modify the user or group permissions using the following cluster and local role binding commands:

Remove a user from a Cluster RBAC role by executing the following:

oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user <role> <username>

Remove a group from a Cluster RBAC role by executing the following:

Each user project is given a separate namespace and OpenShift enforces RBAC policies controlling which projects and services users can access.

OpenShift forces the use of namespaces. Service accounts are a namespace resource as well, so they are segregated. RBAC policies apply to service accounts. In addition, Network Policies are used to control the flow of requests between containers hosted on the container platform.

It is important to define a default Network Policy on the namespace that will be applied automatically to new projects to prevent unintended requests. These policies can be updated by the project's administrator (with the appropriate RBAC permissions) to apply a policy that is appropriate to the service(s) within the project namespace.","","Verify that each user namespace has a Network Policy by executing the following:

for ns in $(oc get namespaces -ojson | jq -r '.items[] | select((.metadata.name | startswith(""openshift"") | not) and (.metadata.name | startswith(""kube-"") | not) and .metadata.name != ""default"") | .metadata.name '); do oc get networkpolicy -n$ns; done

If the above returns any lines saying ""No resources found in <PROJECT> namespace."", this is a finding. Empty output is not a finding.","Add a Network Policy to an existing project namespace by performing the following steps:

1. Create <YOURFILE>.yaml and insert the desired resource Network Policy content. The following is an example resource quota definition:

  name: allow-from-same-namespace

Audit logs capture information about login attempts, commands executed, file access, and other system activities. By starting session audits at system startup, RHCOS ensures that all relevant events are recorded, providing a complete security monitoring solution. Some audit systems also maintain state information only available if auditing is enabled before a given process is created.

By initiating session audits at system startup, RHCOS enhances security monitoring, aids in timely incident detection and response, meets compliance requirements, facilitates forensic analysis, and promotes accountability and governance.","","Verify the RHCOS boot loader configuration has audit enabled, including backlog:

Since the audit data may be part of a larger audit system, it is important for the audit data to also include the container platform name for traceability back to the container platform itself and not just the container platform components. This audit data is important when there are issues, such as security incidents, that must be investigated. To make the audit data worthwhile for the investigation of events, it is necessary to know the outcome of the event.

Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step to ensuring the integrity of audit data. Audit data includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.

It is common for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs.

To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed in order to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

Because availability of the services provided by the container platform, approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows:

(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the container platform must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the container platform must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action must be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.","","Verify there is a Prometheus rule to watch for audit events by executing the following:

Instead of scattered logs across multiple OpenShift components, having a centralized repository simplifies log storage, retention, and retrieval. It provides a single source of truth for audit logs, making it easier to manage and analyze log data.

Centralized audit logs are crucial for incident response and forensic investigations. When a security incident occurs, having audit logs in a central repository allows security teams to quickly access relevant log data for analysis.

It improves time synchronization, mitigates time drift, provides redundancy, and enhances resilience against attacks. Knowing when a sequence of events for an incident occurred is crucial to understand what may have taken place. Without a common clock, the components generating audit events could be out of synchronization and would then present a picture of the event that is warped and corrupted. To give a clear picture, it is important that the container platform and its components use a common internal clock.","","Verify Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) chrony Daemon is configured to use multiple NTP servers by executing the following:

Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include: 
(i) something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN); 
(ii) something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or 
(iii) something a user is (e.g., biometric).

A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.

A nonprivileged account is any information system account with authorizations of a nonprivileged user.

Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet).

Authentication sessions between the authenticator and the application validating the user credentials must not be vulnerable to a replay attack.

Anti-replay is a cryptographically based mechanism; thus, it must use FIPS-approved algorithms. An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message. Note that the anti-replay service is implicit when data contains monotonically increasing sequence numbers and data integrity is assured. Use of DOD PKI is inherently compliant with this requirement for user and device access. Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), including application protocols such as HTTPS and DNSSEC, that use TLS/SSL as the underlying security protocol is also complaint.

Configure the information system to use the hash message authentication code (HMAC) algorithm for authentication services to Kerberos, SSH, web management tool, and any other access method.","","Verify the authentication operator is configured to use a secure transport to an OpenIDConnect provider:

OAuth is an open standard for secure authorization and authentication between different services. By setting a session token inactivity timeout, OpenShift reduces the risk of unauthorized access to a user's session if they become inactive or leave their session unattended. It helps protect against potential session hijacking or session replay attacks.

OpenShift is designed to efficiently manage resources across the cluster. Active sessions consume resources such as memory and CPU. By setting timeouts, OpenShift can reclaim these resources if a session remains inactive for a certain duration. This helps optimize resource allocation and ensures that resources are available for other active sessions and workloads.

OpenShift provides the ability for automatic time-out to debug node sessions on client versions starting with 4.8.36. By setting a time-out, OpenShift can manage the allocation of resources efficiently. It prevents the scenario where a debug session remains active indefinitely, potentially consuming excessive resources and impacting the performance of other applications running on the cluster.

Allowing debug sessions to run indefinitely could introduce security risks. If a session is left unattended or unauthorized access is gained to a debug session, it could potentially compromise the application or expose sensitive information. By enforcing time-outs, OpenShift reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized access and helps maintain the security and stability of the platform.

Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in several ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For nonkernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.

By implementing ASLR, OpenShift reduces the effectiveness of common attacks such as buffer overflow, return-oriented programming (ROP), and other memory corruption exploits.

ASLR enhances the resilience of the OpenShift platform by introducing randomness into the memory layout. This randomization makes it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and launch successful attacks. Even if a vulnerability exists in the system, the randomized memory layout introduced by ASLR reduces the chances of the attacker being able to reliably exploit it, increasing the overall security of the platform.

By randomizing the memory layout, ASLR prevents attackers from precisely predicting the memory addresses needed to execute malicious code. This makes it significantly more challenging for attackers to successfully exploit vulnerabilities and execute arbitrary code on the system.

Protection of Shared Libraries: ASLR also protects shared libraries used by applications running on OpenShift.

By generating audit records for privilege modification attempts, OpenShift enables administrators and security teams to track and investigate any unauthorized or suspicious changes to privileges. These records serve as an essential source of evidence for detecting and responding to potential security incidents.

Audit records for unsuccessful attempts to modify privileges help in identifying unauthorized activities or potential attacks. If an unauthorized entity attempts to modify privileges, the audit records can serve as an early warning sign of a security threat. By monitoring and analyzing such records, administrators can detect and mitigate potential security breaches before they escalate.

Audit records play a vital role in forensic analysis and investigation. In the event of a security incident or suspected compromise, audit logs for privilege modifications provide valuable information for understanding the scope and impact of the incident.","","Verify OpenShift is configured to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to modify privileges occur by executing the following:

for node in $(oc get node -oname); do oc debug $node -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'echo -n ""$HOSTNAME ""; grep -e ""key=unsuccessful-create"" -e ""key=unsuccessful-modification""  -e ""key=delete"" -e ""key=unsuccessful-access"" -e ""actions"" -e ""key=perm_mod"" -e ""audit_rules_usergroup_modification""  -e ""module-change""  -e ""logins"" /etc/audit/audit.rules' 2>/dev/null; done

All the components must use the same standard so that the events can be tied together to understand what took place within the overall container platform. This must establish, correlate, and help assist with investigating the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible.

Without audit record generation, unauthorized users can modify security objects unknowingly for malicious intent creating vulnerabilities within the container platform.

If an unauthorized entity attempts to remove privileges, the audit records can serve as an early warning sign of a security threat. By monitoring and analyzing such records, administrators can detect and mitigate potential security breaches before they escalate.

Audit records play a vital role in forensic analysis and investigation. In the event of a security incident or suspected compromise, audit logs for privilege deletions provide valuable information for understanding the scope and impact of the incident.","","Verify OpenShift is configured to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to delete security privileges occur by executing the following:
 
for node in $(oc get node -oname); do oc debug $node -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'echo -n ""$HOSTNAME ""; grep -e ""key=delete"" -e ""key=perm_mod"" -e ""key=privileged"" -e ""audit_rules_usergroup_modification"" /etc/audit/audit.rules' 2>/dev/null; done

Confirm the following rules exist on each node:

-w /etc/group -p wa -k audit_rules_usergroup_modification
-w /etc/gshadow -p wa -k audit_rules_usergroup_modification
-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k audit_rules_usergroup_modification
-w /etc/security/opasswd -p wa -k audit_rules_usergroup_modification

These records serve as valuable evidence for detecting and responding to potential security incidents.

Audit records for unsuccessful attempts to delete security objects help in identifying unauthorized activities or potential attacks. If an unauthorized entity attempts to delete security objects, the audit records can serve as an early warning sign of a security threat. By monitoring and analyzing such records, administrators can detect and mitigate potential security breaches before they escalate.

Audit records play a vital role in forensic analysis and investigation. In the event of a security incident or suspected compromise, audit logs for security object deletions provide valuable information for understanding the scope and impact of the incident.

Satisfies: SRG-APP-000501-CTR-001265, SRG-APP-000502-CTR-001270","","Verify the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) is configured to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to delete security objects or categories of information occur by executing the following:

Disabling the SSHD service reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities associated with SSH access. SSH is a commonly targeted vector by malicious actors, and disabling the service eliminates the potential risks associated with unauthorized SSH access or exploitation of SSH-related vulnerabilities.

By disabling SSHD, OpenShift can restrict access to the platform to only authorized channels and protocols. This helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access attempts and reduces the exposure to potential brute-force attacks or password-guessing attacks against SSH.

Disabling SSHD encourages the use of more secure and controlled access mechanisms, such as API-based access or secure remote management tools provided by OpenShift.

    - usbguard
"" | oc apply -f -
done

2. Wait for the nodes to reboot.
Note: (>oc get mcp) None of the pools should say Updating=true when the update is done.

3. Enable the service by executing the following:

for mcpool in $(oc get mcp -oname | sed ""s:.*/::"" ); do
echo ""apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1

When a vulnerability within a component or container is unknown or allowed to remain unpatched, other containers and customers within the platform become vulnerability. The vulnerability can lead to the loss of application data, organizational infrastructure data, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) to hosted applications.

Vulnerability scanning can be performed by the container platform or by external applications.","","To check if the Container Security Operator is running, execute the following:

oc get deploy -n openshift-operators container-security-operator -ojsonpath='{.status.readyReplicas}'

If this command returns an error or the number 0, and a separate tool is not being used to perform continuous vulnerability scans of components, containers, and container images, this is a finding.","Vulnerability scanning can be performed by the Container Security Operator, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (formerly StackRox) or by external applications.

It promotes the integrity, authenticity, and nonrepudiation of digital signatures, which are essential for secure communication and data exchange in the OpenShift platform.

SHA1 is disabled in digital signatures when FIPS mode is enabled. OpenShift must verify that the certificates in /etc/kubernetes and /etc/pki are using sha256 signatures.","","Verify the use of a FIPS-compliant hash function for digital signature generation and validation, by executing and reviewing the following commands:

update-crypto-policies --show

If the return is not ""FIPS"", this is a finding.

openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/ca.crt -noout -text | grep Algorithm

If any of the crypto-policies listed are not FIPS compliant, this is a finding. Details of algorithms can be reviewed at the following knowledge base article:
https://access.redhat.com/articles/3642912","Reinstall the OpenShift cluster in FIPS mode. The file install-config.yaml has a top-level key that enables FIPS mode for all nodes and the cluster platform layer. If the install-config.yaml was not backed up prior to consumption as part of the installation, it must be recreated. An example install-config.yaml with some sections trimmed out for brevity, and the ""fips: true"" key applied at the top level is shown below:

apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
controlPlane:
  name: master
  platform:
    aws:
      [...]
  replicas: 3
compute:
- name: worker
  platform:
    aws:
  replicas: 3
metadata:
  name: fips-cluster
networking:
  [...]
platform:
  aws:
    [...]
sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
pullSecret: '{""auths"": ...}'
fips: true

After saving the install-config.yaml with the corresponding correct information, run the installer to create a cluster that uses FIPS-validated Modules in Process cryptographic libraries. The command to install a cluster and consume the install-config.yaml is:

> ./openshift-install create cluster --dir=<installation_directory> --log-level=info
Where <installation_directory> is the directory that contains install-config.yaml
